I am currently working as an SAP SAC (SAP Analytics Cloud) consultant, specializing in helping organizations leverage data analytics and cloud solutions for better decision-making. My passion for finance and technology has driven me to explore SAP FICO (Financial Accounting & Controlling), and I am now committed to mastering FICO skills to enhance my expertise in end-to-end financial processes. I am eager to expand my knowledge in areas like General Ledger, Accounts Payable/Receivable, and Asset Accounting, while applying my analytical experience to optimize SAP FICO implementations.
